{"body":"# **Flashcards for Google Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac)**\r\nv1.0.0\r\n\r\n##What is it?\r\nA set of flashcards that cover the essential keyboard shortcuts (\"hot keys\") available in the *Google Chrome* web browser on the Mac OSX operating system. Multiple formats are included to allow import into most popular Flashcard apps.   \r\n\r\nThese shortcuts were current at Chrome 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n##What's included?\r\nThere are 5 files included with this package:   \r\n\r\n- **readme.md**  \r\nThis file, in Markdown format.\r\n\r\n- **Google Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Tilde.txt**  \r\nThe shortcuts in *tilde-delimited* (~) format. These can be imported into many applications such as quizlet.com or flashcardexchange.com.\r\nThe file is tilde rather than comma-delimited because some of the definitions contain a comma. Most applications will allow you to specify the delimiter character so this file will usually import without problems. \r\nFor some applications to recognize the file you may have to change the extension.\r\n\r\n- **Google Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Tab.txt**  \r\nThe shortcuts in *tab-delimited* (~) format. The second most popular format, when tilde-delimited is not supported.\r\nFor some applications to recognize the file you may have to change the extension.\r\n\r\n- **Google Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Excel.xls**  \r\nThe shortcuts in Microsoft Excel 97-2004 format. These can be imported into apps such as studyblue.com which don't support tilde or tab-delimited files.  \r\nThis file can also be used to easily export the file to other formats.\r\n\r\n- **Google Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac) - Mental Case.studyarch**  \r\nThe shortcuts in *Mental Case* Study Archive format. *Mental Case* is a popular Flashcard application available for Mac OSX and iOS. Although it supports many import formats, \"Study Archive\" is the most convenient. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Licence  \r\nCreated 2012 by David Waterston ([http://dvolvr.davidwaterston.com](http://dvolvr.davidwaterston.com)).   \r\nThese files are copyright and licence free.
